2,T: more comments about the meeting I’d really like to hear from as many people as possible... what comments you had reactions you had to being in that meeting yesterday
,
12,S: Um I don't have anything about the meeting yesterday but I was just thinking about six there was uh... I was thinking that it's uh it can be an odd number to because there could be two two four six... two three twos that makes six and two threes that could be an odd and even number...three things make it and there could be two things make it
,
40,T: and the two things that you put together to make it were odd right? Three and three are each odd?
,
45,S: uh huh anything the twos were even
,
50,T: so you're kind of I think Benny said then that he wasn't talking about every even number right Benny were you saying that?
,
55,B: yeah
,
56,T: some of the even numbers like six are made up of two odds like you just suggested...other people's comments?... Tina
,
68,I: I guess said that six is an odd number I think six can be an odd number because...look...six can be an odd number because this is even odd even odd even odd even ...how could it be an odd number because even odd even odd even odd because 0 is not an odd number
,
97,S: Because because six there can be three of something which makes six and three of something there's like odd like see um you can make two four six THREE TWOS to make that and two threes to make six
,
116,T: Kevin
,
118,K: But that doesn't necessarily mean that six is odd
,
123,T: Why not Kevin?
,
125,K: Because just because you need two odd numbers to add up to an even number doesn't mean it has to be odd
,
134,T: whats the def what's our... Shay what's our working definition of an even number...do you remember from the other day the working definition we were using what is it?
,
142,S: it's...um that...I forgot
,
149,T: could somebody help us out with this because we need in the group to have an idea that we are working with what's the working definition we are using?...do other people know this besides Liz and Shakira...I think other people do...Marta do you know what the definition is that we've been using for an even number?
,
169,T: I'm confused now
,
170,S: you can split six fairly and you can split six not fairly you can like um like cut six in half um... there's like see there's two of them and you had and you had um... six cookies and you didn't want to split it in half so each person get three and you wanted to split in like two so that each person each person would get um... two and there would be two left
,
210,T: for which number now...for six?
,
213,S: uh huh
,
214,T: so are you saying all numbers are odd then?
,
216,S: no I'm not saying all nymbers are odd but...
,
223,T: which numbers are not odd then?
,
225,S: um two four six and um six can be odd or even eight
,
236,U: (inaudible)
,
242,S: because there's three twos! one two three four five six... ok
,
252,T: does everybody understand what Shay's trying to argue he's saying six could be even or it could be odd...well watch what he's going to prove and then you can ask some questions about it
,
259,S: because see this there's two number two over here put that there put this here there's two two and two and that would make six
,
274,"M: I think I know what he is saying… is that it’s, see. "
,
277,T: Lynn can you stay there people have some questions for you
,
280,M: I think what he’s saying is that it's almost I think what he is saying is that you have three groups of two. And three is an odd number so six can be an odd number and an even number. 
,
300,T: do other people agree with that...is that what you are saying Shay?
,
303,S: Yeah.
,
306,T: k do other people agree with him? Lynn you disagree with him?
,
308,M: yeah I disagree with that because it's not according to like here can I show it on the board...it's not according to like how many groups it is let's say that I have...let's say...if you call six an odd number why don't you...let's see...let's say ten one two...and here are ten circles then you would split down let's say I wanted to split them by two I'd go one two...look one two three four five then why do you not call ten like uh...an odd number AND an even number or why don't you call other numbers an odd number and an even number?
,
392,S: I didn't think of it that way. Thank you for bringing it up...so I say it's ten can be an odd or even?
,
403,"M: Yeah but what about other numbers!? Like, if you keep on going on like that and you say that other numbers are odd and even, maybe we'll end up with all numbers are odd and even! Then it won't make sense that all numbers should be odd and even, because if all numbers were odd and even, we wouldn't be even having this discussion!"
